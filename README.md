#README: Diabetes_readmission_Project
Dataset information:
The diabetes data set was collected from 130 US hospitals over almost 10 years (1999-2008). This data set includes 50 different features. The detailed information for each feature can be found found in this folder.
Problem statements & End Goal:
Keenly observing the above issues, we can identify that they are closely related to readmissions in the hospitals. Hence by predicting if a patient gets readmitted within a month we can approximate the readmission rates which helps to suggest better resource management in terms of type and number of doctors, medical equipment etc. needed at a specific time and place.
We tried to build an artificially intelligent model which can classify those patients who might get readmitted within a month by analyzing data pertaining to medical history of a patient. We can identify the importance of each feature of medical documentation with respect to its ability to predict readmissions. We have chosen to address the readmission rates of diabetic patients as diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases in most of the countries.
